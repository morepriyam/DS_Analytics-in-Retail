About this Dataset Analytics in Retail

Channelizing and managing data with the aim of working in favour of the customer as well as generating profits is very significant for survival.
Ideally, a retailer’s customer data reflects the company’s success in reaching and nurturing its customers. Retailers built reports summarizing customer behaviour using metrics such as conversion rate, average order value, recency of purchase and total amount spent in recent transactions. These measurements provided general insight into the behavioural tendencies of the customers.

In a nutshell, for big retail players all over the world, data analytics is applied more these days at all stages of the retail process – taking track of popular products that are emerging, doing forecasts of sales and future demand via predictive simulation, optimizing placements of products and offers through heat-mapping of customers and many others.
